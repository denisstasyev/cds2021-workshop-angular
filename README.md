# [Building a web application in Angular](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/events/week-1/workshops/building-a-web-application-in-angular/) workshop by Sr. Developer Relations Engineer [Mark Thompson](https://github.com/MarkTechson)

Let's have some fun and build an application inspired by vacation rental apps in Angular. In this beginner friendly workshop we'll build an application that uses some of the core features of Angular like components and routing to build a beautiful, functional web application.

Deployed to Github Pages with [Method 1 with angular-cli-ghpages](https://medium.com/tech-insights/how-to-deploy-angular-apps-to-github-pages-gh-pages-896c4e10f9b4):

1. `ng build --prod --base-href "https://denisstasyev.github.io/cds2021-workshop-angular/"`
2. `npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/cds2021-workshop-angular/`

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
